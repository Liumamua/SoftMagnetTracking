# SoftMagnetTracking
Program scripts pubilction for the soft magnet based tracking system review (Tmech).

The file 'BP_pose.mlx' is a live code of MATLAB running the neural network prediction of original 40mm soft magnet 6-DoF pose tracking, using the data file 'NNdata_for_test(40mm soft magnet).mat'.
Here we only upload the test set data because there is a limit on GitHub upload files.

The file 'compare_model2measure_translation_final.mlx' is also a live code of MATLAB which is the comparison between the magnetic measurements and analytical model simulation in the Chapter III, using the data file 'SimulatonComparison(Experiment_data).mat'.
